# TypeScript Components by Rupert

This repository was created as part of a guide to publishing TypeScript React components. You can read the guide over here: [Publishing TypeScript React components to NPM](https://fildon.hashnode.dev/publishing-typescript-react-components-to-npm)

## Getting Started

Install this package:

```shell
npm add typescript-components-by-rupert
```

Import the Counter component:

```js
import { Counter } from "typescript-components-by-rupert";
```

You can then render the `Counter` component like any other React component in JSX.
